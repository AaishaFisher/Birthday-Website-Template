    <h1>Congratulations on your birthday!</h1>
    <p> By the time you recieve this website gift, your birthday will most likely have passed. I 
        know that will most probably be the case as I knew when I got this idea that I'd really 
        put in all my effort. And i did!<br><br>
        Every single thing you see on this website I have created, just for you. I used my skills I already learnt
        at college to create this website, but you see,, I had to learn advanced coding and also I had to learn new 
        design techniues. I also had to learn how to do stop motion. <br>
        The point that I'm trying to make is, I wanted to show you how much you mean to me.<br><br>
        Below are your gifts. Please click on the links hehe. Dw, its safe 
    </p>
