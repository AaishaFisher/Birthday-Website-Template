    <h1>Congratulations on your birthday! ðŸŽ‚ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³</h1>
    <p> By the time you recieve this website gift, your birthday will most likely have passed. I 
        know that will most probably be the case as I knew when I got this idea that I'd really 
        put in all my effort. And i did!<br><br>

        Every single thing you see on this website I have created, just for you. I used what I knew and 
        learnt some advanced skills, not to mention I had to learn a brand new skill called Stop Motion Videography.
        The point that I'm trying to make is, I wanted to show you how much you mean to me. 
         <br><br>
        
        Since our first meeting, you've grown to become an invaluable and cherished friend in my life. 
        Imagining my life without you, Louai, is now impossible. You're not just any friend; you're the
        'Luxumous Prime, the Third' ðŸ˜‚ . I make it a point to continually emphasize your significance in 
        my life, not just on special occasions, but on every occasion. So, I won't delve into lengthy 
        paragraphs about your importance; instead, I hope you always remember how much you mean to me. <br><br>

        Before I stop the mushy-ness, I will die on this rock: You are a role model. You are perfect, flaws and all,
        I have so much admiration and respect for you. You will get everything you desire in life by just continuing
        to be yourself. Your mom raised a good man. 
        <br><br>
